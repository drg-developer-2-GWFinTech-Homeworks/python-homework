## PyBank

Various items are computed which provide a picture of fluctuations in operations on a monthly basis. This enables correlation of good and bad performance metrics with possible external factors to support improvement of business efficiency.


### Steps

The following steps are performed in the PyBank solution:

1. Ingest dataset from Resources/budget_data.csv.

1. Analyze to compute the following information:

    1. The total number of months included in the dataset.

    1. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    1. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

    1. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

1. Generate a report to the console and a file.


## PyRamen

### Steps

The following steps are performed in the PyRamen solution:

1. Data is ingested.

1. Data is manipulated to build a nested dictionary.

1. A report file is generated.
